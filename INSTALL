   You need to install the following on the ec2 ubuntu 12.04 stock image:
   1) mysql
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server

   2) some perl packages
   sudo apt-get install libdbi-perl
   sudo apt-get install libwww-perl
   sudo apt-get install libhtml-treebuilder-xpath-perl
   sudo apt-get install libjson-perl

   3) (for aws) open the incoming port on which you decide to run the server.

   That's it.
